I am a Ph.D. student in computer science at [the Kahlert School of Computing, University of Utah](https://www.cs.utah.edu/). I earned my Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Arizona in computer science and mathematics. 

<span style="color: red;">I am on job market for a full-time role starting in summer/fall 2026. I have two summer internships in Meta and DoorDash working on developing generative recommendation models(Meta) and homepage ranking models(DoorDash).</span>


My PhD research focuses on developing surrogate-based AI models that learn to emulate and reason about complex processes, including both physical systems and human expertise:
  + Surrogates for human experts: I align large language models to act as intelligent surrogates for personalized healthcare coaching and recommendations, using customized techniques such as supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and chain-of-thought reasoning.  
  + Surrogates for physical dynamical systems: I develop probabilistic and generative surrogates for complex physical dynamics such as climate evolution, plasma dynamics, and turbulent fluid flows, to enable efficient simulation, forecasting, and uncertainty quantification.

I am advised by [Dr. Shandian Zhe](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~zhe/).

My research interest includes: Surrogate Modeling, LLM Alignment, Reinforcement Learning
